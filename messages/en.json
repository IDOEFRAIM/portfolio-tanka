I dismantle complexity to the bone to reveal architectural elegance — the kind that simplifies without betraying, that stands when everything else falters.",
    "block_2_title": "THE METHOD",
    "block_2_text": "Rigor. Discipline. Iteration. I code like designing an airplane: every part has a function, every tolerance is measured, every risk is isolated. Nothing is left to chance. My approach is diagnostic-driven: I want states, metrics, and errors exposed to iterate quickly and well. Robustness is not an option, it's the contract.",
    "block_3_title": "THE TARGET",
    "block_3_text": "- Real impact. No hype, no smoke and mirrors. I aim for sustainable performance — systems that hold, evolve, and create measurable value for the user. I build for the real world: constraints, scale, unforeseen events. Scalability is not a slogan, it's a responsibility.",

I currently aspire to become an AI Engineer, AI Researcher and Cloud Architect. No surprise, since I have trained for this since childhood. My greatest ambition is to put my knowledge at the service of the development of my country, Burkina Faso, and to show that with hard work and iron discipline one can come from anywhere and achieve the wildest dreams.
